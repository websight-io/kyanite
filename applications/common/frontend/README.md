## CSS Variables:

CSS Variables are generated automatically in 'global-variables.scss'. These variables can be `used` or `redefined` in your project.

Places where the data necessary to generate css variables are located:
1. `/atomic-design-system/00-token/` - Contain folders named and arranged according to the purpose of css attributes. 
2. `/bulma-overwrite/_variables.scss` - Contain defined spacing names and values.

Important files:
1. `global-variables.scss` - File responsible for generating css variables base on sass maps imported from '/atomic-design-system/00-token/*' and '/bulma-overwrite/_variables.scss'.

IMPORTANT: The names of maps defined in the '/atomic-design-system/00-token/' and '/bulma-overwrite/_variables.scss' can't be changed because the rest of 'atomic-design-system' uses css variables from 'global-variables.scss'.
