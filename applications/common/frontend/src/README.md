# Kyanite FE approach

Kyanite is based on the bulma library, so the approach used is partially imposed from the top. Bulma allows us to override it's variables in several ways, however our approach is to override it with [CSS variables](https://bulma.io/documentation/features/css-variables/). 

# Development

In the case of Bulma components, before adding a new variable, check (by inspecting code in the browser) whether Bulma does not already have a given variable for the component or in the `:root`, e.g. `â€”-kyanite-card-background-color`. If the variable is missing, create it according to the scheme: '-kyanite-custom' + component_name + description, e.g. `--kyanite-custom-input-placeholder-color`. Use given or created variable in styling component.

## Design

## Overwriting in Websight.io

Design is **partially** based on Bulma variables, therefore some of them can be easily overriden. Hovewer, websight.io has custom design and some cases like `has-text-light` and `has-background-light` has different values (in Bulma, there is one variable `$light` and all classes with "light" in name has the same value). It is desirable to overwrite bulma variables (no code repetition etc.) but also not all variables can be overwritten, or the output class (bulma generates most of them throught scss functions) still should be styled in our scss files.

### Additional info

Where you can, please use build-in [Bulma variables](https://bulma.io/documentation/features/css-variables/)

Font weights:
```
--kyanite-weight-light: 300;
--kyanite-weight-normal: 400;
--kyanite-weight-medium: 500;
--kyanite-weight-semibold: 600;
--kyanite-weight-bold: 700;
--kyanite-weight-extrabold: 800;
```
Base theme vars:
```
--kyanite-family-primary
--kyanite-family-secondary
--kyanite-navbar-height

// backgorund color
--kyanite-background

// base text color
--kyanite-text 


// link color
--kyanite-link 

// animation duration
--kyanite-duration 

// easing animation type
--kyanite-easing 
```

Base grey scale (has all the classes:
is-{name}, has-text-{name}, is-background-{name}, has-background-{name}, eg. `has-background-grey`):

```
--kyanite-black-bis: #14161a;
--kyanite-black-ter: #1f2229;
--kyanite-grey-darker: #2e333d;
--kyanite-grey-dark: #404654;
--kyanite-grey: #69748c;
--kyanite-grey-light: #abb1bf;
--kyanite-grey-lighter: #d6d9e0;
--kyanite-white-ter: #f3f4f6;
--kyanite-white-bis: #f9fafb;
```

Grey shades:
```
--kyanite-grey-00 // black
--kyanite-grey-10
--kyanite-grey-20
--kyanite-grey-30
--kyanite-grey-40
--kyanite-grey-50 // base grey color, 50% lightness (same as --kyanite-grey)
--kyanite-grey-60
--kyanite-grey-70
--kyanite-grey-80
--kyanite-grey-90
--kyanite-grey-100
```

Grey shades are generated from grey, grey color is created as any other color: with `h`, `s` and `l`:
```
--kyanite-grey-h: {value}
--kyanite-grey-s: {value}
--kyanite-grey-l: {value}
```
